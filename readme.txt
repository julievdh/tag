SurfDetect.m

Audit only surface periods of tag deployment. Works for D2 and D3 deployment. 

Calls on 	d3tagaudit_surf to audit D3 files
		tagaudit_surf to audit D2 files - built off tagaudit_fhj so can select 'i' to save .wav file

When a surface period ends, the audit will move to the next surface period automatically.
Quit the audit using 'q' periodically to save.
